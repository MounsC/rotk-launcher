/**
 * Startup breadcrumbs for the launcher's main process.
 *
 * Until its window is on screen the launcher cannot say what it is doing: the
 * diagnostics service is built late in initialize(), and a Chromium abort
 * leaves only a Windows Error Reporting entry. Launcher 2.0.14 died exactly
 * there (issue #59): elevated, the process could not spawn its GPU and
 * renderer children and Chromium ended it with "GPU process isn't usable.
 * Goodbye." — nothing on disk said which step had been reached. This log
 * answers that question after the fact: one line per step, written
 * synchronously so a hard abort right after a step still leaves its line.
 *
 * Writes never throw. A launcher that cannot write its breadcrumbs must still
 * start.
